# _Python Diary
Repository to share some fun python code and projects, (including):
1. A movie website created by applying the Object oriented programming concepts learnt during the Udacity Python Programming Course.
Hope y'all like the movies in this collection. :D

2. A program that reminds you, it is BREAK-TIME! with the best of Mozart.

3. An attempt at a Hangman -game (coded procedurally) 

4. Automating script: the Most Boring job of moving files (by their extension)!
